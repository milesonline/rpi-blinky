# Rasperry Pi LED Flash Project

This is my first step into physical computing. This is a simple program that flashes and LED using my Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins

## Requirements:
- Raspberry Pi 4/5
- LED connected to GPIO pin 17
- Python 3.x
- RPi.GPIO library

## Setup:
1. Connect the LED to GPIO pin 17.
2. Clone this repo or download the `led_flash.py` script.
3. Run the script on your Raspberry Pi using `python led_flash.py`.
